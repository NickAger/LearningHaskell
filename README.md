# LearningHaskell
Learning Haskell by studying:

* [Haskell Programming from first principles](http://haskellbook.com) - [@haskellbook](https://twitter.com/haskellbook) - my main learning resource
* [Penn University CIS 194](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/lectures/01-intro.html) - I completed the [exercises](https://github.com/NickAger/LearningHaskell/tree/master/CIS194) for first 4 lectures.  
* [Well-Typed Haskell training](http://www.well-typed.com/services_training/)

The majority of the work is in: [HaskellProgrammingFromFirstPrinciples](https://github.com/NickAger/LearningHaskell/tree/master/HaskellProgrammingFromFirstPrinciples). I would love to compare my exercises solutions with others learning haskell through [Haskell Programming from first principles](http://haskellbook.com) book. Please contact me.

Workspaces made within [Haskell for Mac](http://haskellformac.com) and code outside of [Haskell for Mac](http://haskellformac.com) playgrounds was developed using
[Atom configured for Haskell](http://achernyak.me/universal-haskell-dev-enviornment) and then laterly using [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vans.haskero).

# Free Monad

> Free monads let you decompose any impure program into a pure representation of its behavior and a minimal impure interpreter.

> Philip Walder:
> With distribution becoming so important, we need to focus on programs that run on multiple machines, sending values from one to the other. When you send a value, you probably want it to be the value itself (eager evaluation), rather than a program (and the values of all the free variables of the program) that can be evaluated to yield the value. So, in the distributed world, I think it would be better to be eager by default but make it easy to be lazy when you want.
