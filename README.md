# LearningHaskell
Learning Haskell by studying:

* [Haskell Programming from first principles](http://haskellbook.com) - [@haskellbook](https://twitter.com/haskellbook) - my main learning resource
* [Penn University CIS 194](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/lectures/01-intro.html) - I completed the [exercises](https://github.com/NickAger/LearningHaskell/tree/master/CIS194) for first 4 lectures.  
* [Well-Typed Haskell training](http://www.well-typed.com/services_training/)

The majority of the work is in: [HaskellProgrammingFromFirstPrinciples](https://github.com/NickAger/LearningHaskell/tree/master/HaskellProgrammingFromFirstPrinciples). I would love to compare my exercises solutions with others learning haskell through [Haskell Programming from first principles](http://haskellbook.com) book. Please contact me.

Workspaces made within [Haskell for Mac](http://haskellformac.com) and
[Atom configured for Haskell](http://achernyak.me/universal-haskell-dev-enviornment)/Visual Studio Code.
