# Learning Haskell
Exercises completed while working through [Haskell Programming from first principles](http://haskellbook.com). 

Please contact me, if you'd like to compare solutions.

Most code is contained in workspaces made within http://haskellformac.com, however the [checkers](https://github.com/conal/checkers) library isn't currently in http://haskellformac.com, so in those cases I have a more conventional [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) directory setup. 

For comparing solutions, I've found the following other developers' repositories of exercises from [Haskell Programming from first principles](http://haskellbook.com) useful:
